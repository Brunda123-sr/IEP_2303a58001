# KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM - LAB 1
This repository contains my C implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree.
#### This project demonstrates an implementation of Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm using the C programming language. It takes a weighted undirected graph as input and outputs the edges that form the Minimum Spanning Tree along with its total cost.

## ALGORITHM OVERVIEW
#### Kruskal’s Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the MST of a connected, undirected graph. It works by:
##### Sorting all edges by increasing weight.
##### Iteratively adding the smallest edge to the MST, as long as it doesn’t form a cycle.
##### Using Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) to detect cycles.


# MATRIX
This project implements the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem using Dynamic Programming. It determines the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices by minimizing the number of scalar multiplications and displaying the optimal parenthesization.

## ALGORITHM OVERVIEW
##### Dynamic Programming.
##### Computes minimum multiplication cost using a bottom-up approach.
##### Builds a cost table and a split table to reconstruct the optimal parenthesization.
